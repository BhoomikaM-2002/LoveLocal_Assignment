    "Certainly! Let's break down the logic and algorithm of the code for finding the length of the last word in a given string.\n",
    "1. Split the String:\n",
    "   - The first step is to split the input string into words. This is done using the `split` method.\n",
    "   - The `split` method without any arguments splits the string based on whitespace by default. This gives us a list of words.\n",
    "2. Access the Last Word:\n",
    "   - Once the string is split, we can access the last word in the list.\n",
    "   - In Python, indexing with `-1` refers to the last element in a list.\n",
    "3. Calculate and Return Length:\n",
    "   - After obtaining the last word, the code calculates its length using the `len` function.\n",
    "   - The length of the last word is the desired result, so the function returns this length.\n",
    "4. Example:\n",
    "   - Let's consider the string \"Hello World\". After splitting, we get the list `['Hello', 'World']`.\n",
    "   - Accessing the last element with `[-1]` gives us `'World'`.\n",
    "   - The length of the last word, in this case, is 5, which is then returned by the function."
